## Project Description

I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Features & Libraries

* Javascript
* HTML
* D3
* JSON

## My Process

1. Read in the JSON dataset using D3.
2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Display the individual's demographic information.
5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object on the page.
6. Adapt a gauge chart to pot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
7. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
8. Deploy app to a static page.
